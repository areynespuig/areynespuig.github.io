**User Profile**

The main target of this website is anyone who wants to get to know me professionally — recruiters, professors, or potential collaborators. I wanted the page to give a clear and quick overview of who I am, what I study, and what I can do. A recruiter visiting the site should immediately understand my skills and background, while classmates or teachers can use it as a quick reference to my projects and experience.

The website focuses on simplicity and accessibility. Visitors can easily change the language (English, Catalan, or Spanish) depending on what feels most natural to them, and they can switch between light and dark mode for comfort. I also included direct links to LinkedIn, GitHub, and my downloadable résumé, so people can check my professional activity in more depth.

Overall, the website is designed for people who appreciate clean, fast, and modern interfaces — something that feels personal yet professional. It reflects my own approach to development: organized, efficient, and user-friendly.

**Information Architecture**

The website is structured as a single-page layout to minimize friction and let visitors scan my profile in one pass. A sticky top navigation links to the core sections: Home, About, Education, Experience, and Projects. The order mirrors a typical hiring glance: identity first, then skills and background, followed by concrete evidence through roles and work. Each block is self-contained, uses a clear heading, and keeps supporting text short to favour quick reading.

The Hero introduces name, focus, location note, and action buttons for Projects, LinkedIn, GitHub, and a résumé download. About expands with a concise bio and a bullet list of key competencies spanning front-end, back-end, algorithms, Linux, Docker, and Git. Education is a vertical timeline, reading newest to oldest for quick context. Experience uses card components listing title, organization, and responsibilities.

Projects is a horizontal carousel designed for incremental additions; each card pairs a thumbnail with a short description and an external link. Global conveniences include a three-language switcher (EN/CA/ES) and a light/dark theme toggle, both persisted with localStorage. The layout grid adapts responsively: on narrow viewports the navbar collapses, the hero photo stacks, and two-column cards become single column.

Finally, a minimalist Footer provides credits and current year. Overall, the architecture prioritizes clarity, hierarchy, and speed.

**Visual Design**

Visually, I wanted the site to feel modern and minimalistic — something that represents my personal taste and approach as a developer. I built it from scratch using HTML, CSS, and a small amount of JavaScript, without relying on frameworks. The color palette combines dark tones with violet and cyan gradients (#7c5cff, #53d6ff), which bring a sense of creativity and technology.

The typography uses Inter for text and Poppins for titles, creating a balance between readability and character. Rounded corners, subtle shadows, and soft gradients give the interface a smooth and professional feel. The default theme is dark, but users can toggle a light mode if they prefer.

I also focused on small interactions — hover effects, transitions, and smooth contrasts — to make the page feel alive without overwhelming the user. Each component (cards, buttons, chips) follows the same style system for consistency. Overall, the design expresses clarity, simplicity, and personality, aligning with how I like to build things: elegant, efficient, and user-centered.
